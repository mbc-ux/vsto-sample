# vsto-sample
### addin-client directory contains vsto addin for excel interaction along with a custom task pane to make a HTTP GET request to the endpoint provided.
### services directory contains an out of the box webapi project generated by visual studio which includes a single endpoint that returns static weather sample data.
### tests directory contains a unit test project which has code coverage for a couple of classes (excluding the addin client itself which serves as the bootstrapping of the application and the model class due to the interactivity with the web client).
### the coverage for the model could be updated if needed by wrapping the webrequest logic into another interface and class so that it could be mocked as a dependency.
#### All projects and functionality can be run from within Visual Studio. Prism and Mocking frameworks were decided not to be used since there were only a very small number of usages for them here. in a larger scale application or as the number of features and complexity grows this may make more sense.
